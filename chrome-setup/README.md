# `chrome-setup.sh`

This script installs the selected version of `chrome` and `chromedriver` ([chrome-for-testing](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/chrome-for-testing)) in Semaphore's jobs.

*At the moment only `linux64` is supported.*

## How it works

It will download and extract `chrome-linux64.zip` and `chromedriver-linux64.zip` packages for the chosen version and update symlinks.

Use it for versions `115.0.5763.0` and above since this is the lowest supported version for `chromedriver` for this installation method.

For fast and reliable installation in jobs, Semaphore will host a limited number of versions.
<br>Those supported versions can be found in this [variable](chrome-setup.sh#L6).

It is recommended to use versions available from Semaphore's repository, but if you need some other version the script will automatically try to fetch it from Google's repository based on [known-good-versions-with-downloads.json](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/known-good-versions-with-downloads.json) list.

## How to use it

Download the script, make it executable, and run it with the desired version.

```
